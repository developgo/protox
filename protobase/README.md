# protobase

Provides design protocols for extending, replacing and creating new subsystems that
plug into current flow of the program. A contract provides minimal required functionality
excluding operating layer ( e.g. threading model ), dependencies and initialization layer.

  "One of the best solutions for ensuring plain dealing is the contract.
   A contract defines your rights and responsibilities, as well as those of the other party. 
   In addition, there is an agreement concerning repercussions if either party fails to abide by the contract." - The Pragmatic Programmer
